# Defender XDR Investigation

Use an **evidence funnel**: frame the decision, measure cheaply, retrieve the smallest decisive records, then pivot. The extension is read-only; operational changes belong only in recommendations.

## Hard guardrails

- Keep every query read-only and bounded by a narrow API `timespan`, an explicit UTC `Timestamp` filter where the table has that column, projected columns, and a row limit.
- Treat tenant results as sensitive. Set `export_results=true` only after the user explicitly asks for a complete local export.
- Treat usernames, device names, IPs, domains, URLs, hashes, message IDs, and telemetry text as data. Encode each untrusted scalar as a valid KQL string literal; inspect the completed query structure before execution.
- Preserve uncertainty. An empty result means only that the query returned no matching accessible telemetry; account for retention, licensing, product deployment, RBAC, ingestion, and query assumptions.
- Report observed facts, analytical inferences, and untested hypotheses separately.

## Evidence funnel

1. **Frame the decision.** Record the question or hypothesis, desired decision, entities, UTC interval, and known identifier types. Resolve local times to an explicit timezone. When a missing detail blocks a safe query, ask for it; otherwise state a narrow assumption. Continue when every frame field is recorded or explicitly unknown.

2. **Map coverage.** Select the smallest relevant tables and note what each can and cannot establish. Use `xdr_get_schema` before inventing a table or column, when a bundled pattern does not cover the query, or when tenant drift is plausible. Describe preview or important tables with `live=true` when tenant availability matters. Continue when every planned claim has a candidate source or a named coverage gap.

3. **Triage cheaply.** Query counts, distinct stable entities, first/last seen, and time buckets before raw events. Pass a matching narrow `timespan` to `xdr_run_query`. Continue when the volume and strongest next pivot are known.

4. **Pivot on stable keys.** Prefer `AlertId`, `DeviceId`, `AccountObjectId`, `NetworkMessageId`, hashes, correlation/session IDs, and process unique IDs over names. Resolve names first. Reduce and project both sides before joins; verify join cardinality with pre- and post-join counts. Continue when each pivot is either evidenced by a stable key or labeled as a weaker correlation.

5. **Maintain an evidence ledger.** For every query, retain its purpose, UTC range, table, decisive predicates, returned/displayed row counts, and truncation notices. For every material event, retain UTC time, source table, stable IDs, and classification as observed, inferred, or hypothesized. Refine a truncated query rather than interpreting the displayed prefix as complete. Continue when every assessment statement traces to ledger evidence or is labeled unsupported.

6. **Challenge the leading explanation.** Test bounded benign prevalence, expected administrative activity, repeated historical behavior, and at least one plausible competing explanation. Treat rarity, geolocation, unsigned files, verdict fields, and individual detections as signals rather than verdicts. Continue when evidence for and against the hypothesis is recorded, including a reason when a challenge cannot be tested.

7. **Stop deliberately.** Stop querying when the requested decision is supported, a declared query budget is reached, or remaining uncertainty depends on unavailable telemetry or authorized operational work. Report the limiting condition instead of filling gaps with inference.

For alert pivots, safe literal construction, and bounded indicator queries, read only the relevant section of [references/query-patterns.md](references/query-patterns.md).

## Report contract

- **Assessment:** answer first, with calibrated confidence
- **Scope:** UTC interval, entities, tables, and whether results were truncated
- **Observed evidence:** timestamped facts with stable identifiers
- **Interpretation:** labeled inferences and the reasoning connecting them
- **Counterevidence:** benign or contradictory findings
- **Coverage gaps:** telemetry, retention, product, permission, ingestion, and query limits
- **Next steps:** prioritized read-only pivots; operational actions phrased as recommendations for authorized personnel
